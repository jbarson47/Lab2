  In closest_wendys.py, I initialized the closest_dist variable to 10000000, instead of 200 as was the case in the original version of the file. This is an improvement because if a case occurs where the true value of closest_dist is larger than 200, this program will report an inaccurate result. 10000000 is a number that is so large that there are no cases that would cause an inaccurate result to be reported, so therefore it is a more effective initial value for closest_dist than 200.
